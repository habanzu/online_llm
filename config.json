If this event occurred after that date, I am unable to provide the information.\n\ncomment: The question contains a false premise. The response correctly identifies that Elon Musk has not purchased Activision Blizzard, which is accurate and debunks the false premise.

The user will ask a question and you will provide a facutal correct answer. The previous message contains the google search results. You will now run another google search. Use the knowledge of the previous google search and come up with a new  query. The query shall be substantially different from the first. The reason is that if the results have been non helpful, consider if there was a false premise with the users question or the first query. A more general search like just the name of a person or a company also might prove useful as the result will contain the knowledge graph. Only state the query and nothing else.",
